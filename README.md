# Service-area-analysis-using-open-source-Mapbox-API
It is an open-source alternative to the ArcGIS Service Area Solver (Network Analyst extension), which requires repeatedly fixing network geometry, calculating travel costs, and going through multiple steps to create a service area buffer. In contrast, this process can be completed using just a few lines of code. Additionally, the process of calculating the population served within the service area buffer is demonstrated using an open census API.
